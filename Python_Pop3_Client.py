# Python Poplib
# poplib — POP3 protocol client
# This module defines a class, POP3, which encapsulates a connection to a POP3 server and implements the protocol as defined in RFC 1939.
# The POP3 class supports both the minimal and optional command sets from RFC 1939. The POP3 class also supports the STLS command introduced
# in RFC 2595 to enable encrypted communication on an already established connection.
# Additionally, this module provides a class POP3_SSL, which provides support for connecting to POP3 servers that use SSL as an underlying protocol layer.
# POP3
# 
# Here is a minimal example (without error checking) that opens a mailbox and retrieves and prints all messages:
# 
#

import getpass, poplib

M = poplib.POP3('localhost')

M.user(getpass.getuser())
M.pass_(getpass.getpass())

numMessages = len(M.list()[1])

for i in range(numMessages):

    for j in M.retr(i+1)[1]:
        print(j)
